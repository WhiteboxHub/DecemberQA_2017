Alter table with constraints  
Delete table
Create table with constraints

MySQL CONSTRAINTs are :
NOT NULL
UNIQUE
PRIMARY KEY
FOREIGN KEY
CHECK
DEFAULT


Create table customers ( id int primary key,
                                         name varchar(20) not null,
                                         Email varchar(20) unique);
Insert into customers values(1, ‘john’,’john@gmail.com), 
                                             ( 2, ‘jane’, ‘jane@gmail.com’),
                                             ( 3, ‘jake’,’jake@gmail.com’);

Insert into customers (id, name) values (4, ‘joseph’);

Update customers set email=’joseph@gmail.com’ where id=4;

-- deletes all the rows
Delete from customers;
-- delete a particular row when the condition is specified
Delete from customer where id = 2;
-- all records are committed by default.
- my sql transaction are commited 
Select @@autocommit;    cannot be rolled back
Commit value can be changed
Set autocommit =0;
 
Select * from customers;
Delete from customers;
Rollback;
Select * from customers;

Any dml commands can be got back using rollback.

Delete
Delete all records from table when condition is specified
Specify condition to delete particular records
You can rollback the transaction
Fire triggers before you delete (what is trigger --- are any event happens it will trigger the particular command)
A trigger is a named database object that is associated with a table, and that activates when a particular event occurs for the table. Some uses for triggers are to perform checks of values to be inserted into a table or to perform calculations on values involved in an update.

Truncate
Delete all the records from the table 
-there is no option to provide where condition it will delete all the records
In truncate you cannot rollback it is for all ddl statement
Delete executes slowere compared to truncate delete uses cache which enables us to rollback. Since truncate cannot be rolled back it does not cache so it is faster



Dml
Delete from customers where id = 2;
ddl
Truncate
Drop
Triggers
Any 

Drop
Drop delete all records alongwith the schema or structure of the table.
So you cannot use the table. You need to create again.

Drop table customers;
Select * from customers;
---table does not exist----


The above are important interview questions

DATABASE OBJECTS
Objects which are physically existing in the db.
Tables, stored procedures, functions, triggers, views, etc.

Table - a physical structure to store data. Contains rows and columns. Rows are  interrelated data/information, columns are list of same information

St pro - set of commands 
Usually we right inline commands. In stored procedures, we give a set of commands in the required order of execution to get the desired result.

Click stored pro -- create store procedure

Create procedure ‘getcustomers‘()
Begin
Select * from customers;
End
Call getcustomers()
Create procedure ‘getcustomers‘( id int)
Begin
Select * from customers where cust_id = id;
End
Call getcustomers(2);

Create procedure ‘getcustomers‘( id int)
Begin
Select * from customers;
Select * from customers where cust_id = id;
End

You can use for insert, update 
Compared to inline commands stored procedure is better.
First time it complies second time it only executes
So faster and secure than inline commands
Accessibility can be controlled for the operations.

Overview
Performance is good 
Once created sp are compiled and stored in database.



Functions  -   Date Function
CREATE DEFINER=`root`@`localhost` FUNCTION `getdatebasedonindex`(
 dtDate DATETIME,
    intMonthIndex INT
) RETURNS date
BEGIN
RETURN
    DATE_SUB(
        LAST_DAY(
            DATE_ADD(dtDate, INTERVAL intMonthIndex MONTH)
        ), 
        INTERVAL DAY(
            LAST_DAY(
                DATE_ADD(dtDate, INTERVAL intMonthIndex MONTH)
            )
        )-1 DAY
    );

END
Select getdatebasedonindex(‘2017-04-04’, 2)

Reusable , returns only one value

Triggers - to fire some events
Triggers are called before an event
Events which fires before/after crud operations
Countries-before insert  audit table hr audit to keep track of all the transactions

VIEWS
Virtual table 
Any update or delete command on the view affects the main table
Rules to follow are the same constraints to be set in view
Referential integrity constraint in the main table then view must contain that
Column and proper value must be provided to that column.

CREATE 
    ALGORITHM = UNDEFINED 
    DEFINER = `root`@`localhost` 
    SQL SECURITY DEFINER
VIEW `cust` AS
    SELECT 
        `customers`.`Cust_id` AS `Cust_id`,
        `customers`.`Cust_name` AS `Cust_name`,
        `customers`.`Cust_email` AS `Cust_email`
    FROM
        `customers`

Select * from cust;



Transactions
Commit
Rollback
Savepoint

Start transaction
Insert into customers …
…
…
If (condition)
rollback
Else commit
Savepoint marker

Set autocommit = 0;
Start transaction;
Insert into customers(cust_id, cust_name) values ( 11, ‘Jaden’);
Insert into customers(cust_id, cust_name) values ( 12, ‘Jonas’);
Rollback;
commit;


Autoincrement options

Indexes - database object

Create unique index custname on
customers(cust_name)

Create index upper_name on customers upper(cust_name);
Drop index 

Assignment
Create Student database
-- send email

Call for ui / qa student list for which batch

Change phone number to ()- pattern

When insert student id auto where student id is 
Autoincrement number + Month of join date sep + Year of join date 17 

-- todays View transaction index procedure functions triggers
