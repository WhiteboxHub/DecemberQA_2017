Procedure

Considering a store example

dayStartUpTask

 - check for stock
 - reorder
 - raise invoice
 - check for employee attendance
 
 
 Procedure
 call the procedure
 
 - ran faster as it is precompiled
 - errors are less
 - more organised
 
 it can take argument for input
 it can also return values
 
 call by reference
 
 CREATE DEFINER=`root`@`localhost` PROCEDURE `getManagerwithJobId`(job varchar(15), sal decimal(8,2))
BEGIN

select manager_id, employee_id, first_name from employees where job_id=job;
sal = select max(salary) from employees where job_id=job;

END


Procedure
 a set of routine to be executed example daily task
 it can return multiple values
 Functions can be called within procedures
 
 
 Function
   it is for more specific purpose
   it is precompiled
   it can return only one value
   
   
   max(), min, avg(), substr()
   functions are independent and it can be used within procedures
   functions should be written as a more reusable code
   
   CREATE DEFINER=`root`@`localhost` 
FUNCTION `initCap`(fname varchar(15)) 
RETURNS varchar(15) CHARSET utf8
BEGIN

RETURN concat(upper(substr(fname,1,1)),substr(fname,2)) ;
END


Triggers
  based on an event if we have to perform any action, it can be done
  using triggers.
  
  
 LIMIT 
 how many record needed in output
 
 correlated queries 
 
  is also a subquery but the subquery accesses the main queries
  they are inefficient
  
  SELECT employee_id, first_name 
FROM employees 
WHERE employee_id IN (SELECT employee_id
FROM job_history 
WHERE job_id= 'IT_PROG');

write a join for the above query



Transaction

 while adding to cart
    1. authenticate the card info
	2. passing the value to the credit card system
	3. updating database salevalue, stock
	  if step 3 fails
	  
	  should step 1 AND 2 be executed
	  rollback
	
	
	start transaction
	
	...
	...  savepoint  marker
	
	if ...pass
	      
		 statement marker
		 commit
		 
	else rollback
	
	
	autocommit
	
	
	indexes
	indexing - every database has its own algo to create indexes
	indexes help in executing joins and subquery faster
