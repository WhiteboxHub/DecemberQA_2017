JVM, JRE, JDK

JVM:- Java Virtual Machine. 
               .java  file - complier- bytecode (.class file)
 it will RAM. 

JRE:- Java Runtime  Environment : physically exists.
                    JRE:- JVM + set of lib, jar files
 
JDK:- Java Development Kit:-  physically exists.
            JDK - JRE+developement tools

Oops:- 

object : it is an entity has state and behavior. (jyothi, hima, aruna)(cat,dog,rat)
class:- collection of object (person, Animal) 


inheritance
Polymorphism
Abstraction
Encapsulation

Naming conventions:-

class:- Animal, Person-- Starts with uppercase and noun
interface:-  ActionListener- Starts with uppercase and adjective
Method Name:-  display- Starts with Lowercase and verb
Variable:-  name, age- Starts with Lowercase
Package :-  wbl, com, java - all should be in Lowercase
Constants:- PRIORITY, PI- all should be in uppercase

Constructor:- special type of method , will use to initialize the object :- it will invoked at btime of object creation. 
                must be same as class name....
                must have must have no return type.
 two types of constructor:- 

                    default constructor
                    parameterized constructor
 note:- if there is no constructor , compiler automatically creates a default constructor.  

3 WAYS TO Initialize Object:- 
            by Reference Variable
              by method
               by constructor

Static keyword:- memory management 
                            used to refer the common property of all objects. 
 e.g student-- college will be same of all student.. ( 500 students)
                         
                    static can be- variable, method, block, nested class. 

this keyword:-  reference variable that refers to current object.. local variable and instance variable with same name to differentiate , will use "this"
 
Inheritance:- object acquires all properties from parent object 
                    using " extends" keyword....
