what is web service?

service available on web..
communication between applications over the web.
provides standard protocol /format for communication
platform independent communication
 using it two different app can talk to each other... exchange data/ information..

real time example:-

two types of web services:-

SOAP:- Simple Object Access Protocol
               Medium - HTTP METHODS
               Format- XML
REST:- Representational State Transfer
               Medium - Http methods
               Format- XML/JSON/TEXT.....

SOAP WEB SEVICES:-
 client:-- ques:-
               what are the services available on the server.
                  what are the request /response parameters?
                    how to call web services?
WSDL:- ( Web Service Description Language):- service provider publish that describe all attributes of that web service.
XML Based interface. used to describe functionality of web services. server will create wsdl and client get it.

developer will give  you WSDL.

          It contains:-
                              definition of web service
                              messages
                              services end point.
                              Binding(SOAP Request and Response)

UDDI:- (Universal Description, Discovery and Integration) - online directory--all wsdl..

               phone directory.--all phone number...
service provider publishes web services..

SOAP VS REST:-

SOAP:--- Protocol- http/ftp..
               platform independent
               WSDL
               In build security
               xml
                       heavy weight

REST:- PROTOCOL- http
               json/xml/text.csv..
               light weight
               easy to understand
               implements some methods to get security.

Web services-  what we have to test in web services?
                    Functional testing, security testing, load testing, status code, schema compliance, content-types, response data, data types, valid / invalid status code..

soapui --tool test soapui soap web services..now a days it supports REST API
OPEN SOURCE. PAID VERSION

Test Suite--> combination of test cases--> test step..
Assertions-> Expected value vs actual value-> success/failure.

 web services:- request and response (Header and body(payload))
REQUEST:- Header, Body(payload), Authentication,
Response- Header and body
                    content type, content length, data count, element present, value present, status code

HTTP status:-

     200 - ok
     201- created
     400- bad request
     404-page not found
     405-method not allowed
     409- conflicts
      500- internal server error

HTTP Methods:-

GET:- Read only access to resource
PUT:- create new resource update resource
POST:- Create new resource
Delete:- remove resource
add- 4+2=6    --actual response             docs--expected response-6 -- assertion pass
                7                                                                                                              fail
actual response and expected response--> compare

 property transfer:- storing or retrieving data from  property file.
 1 transfer property from  property file to SOAP Request.
 2 transfer property from Response of first Request to another Request.
