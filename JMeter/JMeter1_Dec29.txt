Performance - non functional testing

Why do you need performance testing
to chk how the app responds to different loads
response time

What do you mean by load ?
when you have multiple users how the application responds
how many requests can an web appliacation/web server take
if the app crashes on excess load

Why do we need to check how the application is responding?

ip - 123.34.9.244  ---- name abc.com
                                 .net
								 .in

Now think as a users

what are the requirements the user will watchful for



You also need to think in business perspective

to check for business requirements
CPU, memory, web servers, tools, is the load enough
how many users the web application should server

Performance testing
To test for System parameters, responsiveness, stability and workload

Speed, Scalability, Stability

Load test - to check for number of concurrent user and transactions
Stress test - to check breaking point 
Spike test - to check for unusual increment or decrement
Endurance test - validate for a long period of time
Volume testing  -  data base
Scalability testing - capability of the system, network, processors, bandwidth
   electronic and networking systems.
   
   We need a tool to simulate the environment needed for 
   performance testing

   JMeter - open source, Java 
   
   Test Plan - Test Script
   Thread - users
   Samplers - make a requests
   Config Element - elements needed for testing
   Timer
   Listener
   Pre processors
   Post processors

   rampup period - time taken in second to start all the threads
   
   shutdown - suddenly stops the current iteration and exits the 
               testscript
   stop - run the current iteration and then stop execution
   
   sample time - time taken for executing that thread
   bytes - total no of bytes returned
   latency - is time taken to receive the first byte response
   connect time - time taken to connect to the server
   
   Assertion - validate for the requirements by performing some conditions
