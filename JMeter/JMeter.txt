Performance - non functional testing

Why do you need performance testing
to chk how the app responds to different loads
response time

What do you mean by load ?
when you have multiple users how the application responds
how many requests can an web appliacation/web server take
if the app crashes on excess load

Why do we need to check how the application is responding?

ip - 123.34.9.244  ---- name abc.com
                                 .net
								 .in

Now think as a users

what are the requirements the user will watchful for



You also need to think in business perspective

to check for business requirements
CPU, memory, web servers, tools, is the load enough
how many users the web application should server

BRD, SRS, Requirement Matrix 


Performance testing
To test for System parameters, responsiveness, stability and workload

Speed, Scalability, Stability

Load test - to check for number of concurrent user and transactions
Stress test - to check breaking point 
Spike test - to check for unusual increment or decrement
Endurance test - validate for a long period of time
Volume testing  -  data base
Scalability testing - capability of the system, network, processors, bandwidth
   electronic and networking systems.
   
   We need a tool to simulate the environment needed for 
   performance testing
   
   
   Loadrunner - paid , license
   
   JMeter - open source, Java 
   
   Test Plan - Test Script
   Thread - users
   Samplers - make a requests
   Config Element - elements needed for testing
   Timer
   Listener
   Pre processors
   Post processors
   Logic controllers
   Graph
   
   rampup period - time taken in second to start all the threads
   
   shutdown - suddenly stops the current iteration and exits the 
               testscript
   stop - run the current iteration and then stop execution
   
   sample time - time taken for executing that thread
   bytes - total no of bytes returned
   latency - is time taken to receive the first byte response
   connect time - time taken to connect to the server
   
   Assertion - validate for the requirements by performing some conditions
   
   Aggregate graph 
   
   What is the difference between URL and URI ?
   URL 
   
   www.whiteboxqa.com
   www.walmart.com
   
   URL is a subset of URI
   
   URI - identifier
   
   www.walmart.com/search?item=clothes
   
   ipaddress/path?querystring
   
   HTTPRecorder Proxy
   
   Proxy server - is an intermediate between the client and server
   
      what is a port
   1. Add Non-test element Http test recorder in Workbench
   2. Set a port number for the proxy server
   3. go to firefox, set the network for manual proxy for the 
       same port
	4. start the server. check for the certificate
	5. in firefox import the certificate
	6. record your scripts.
	
	set up
	record
	validate
	report
   
   
   
   
   Data Driven
   
   When  we externalize the data from the test script
   
   
   Blaze meter
   1. add the plugin using webstore in chrome
   2. log into blazemeter using gmail account
   3. click the blzemeter icon in chrome, start recording
   4. record your test script
   5. export your script
   
   >>for user defined variable
   in thread group add ,config element -user defined variable 
   and set parameters
   in your parameter add the variable name ${variablename}
   
   >> for data driven csv file
   for csv create a file with .csv
   add config element csv data set config
   use appropriate setting
   in your parameter add the variable name ${variablename}
   
   >>>execution order of test elements
